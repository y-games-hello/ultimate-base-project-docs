# Introduction

UBP is built around a **modular service system**. Every major system (Audio, Save, Scenes, etc.) is managed as a service and accessible from anywhere in the project.

Whether you’re a solo developer or part of a larger team, UBP provides a production-ready environment designed to save you countless hours on setup, architecture decisions, and backend implementation. Instead of reinventing the wheel every project, just import UBP and **start creating**.

## ⚡ Instant Productivity

With UBP, you don’t need to worry about setting up your game's core systems. Everything is ready from the start:

- 🎮 **Need to play a sound?** Just call `PlaySFX()`
- 💾 **Want to save the game?** Use `SaveGame()` and you're done
- 🧠 **Need data persistence, management, or loading?** It's all built-in and extensible
- 🐞 **Need in-game debugging?** Open the **Debug Console** and run your commands or check logs
- 🔁 **Want to load another scene?** Just call `LoadScene()`
- And much more!

This project is structured to feel like a natural extension of Unity — intuitive, familiar, but vastly more powerful.

## 🧩 Extensible, Not Restrictive

Every part of UBP is **designed to be extended**. You can build your own systems on top of existing services or inject custom implementations.
