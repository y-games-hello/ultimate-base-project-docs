## üß™ Example Usage

### Play a Sound Effect (SFX)

```csharp
Services.Get<AudioService>().PlaySFX(sfxClip, transform.position);
```

With custom volume and pitch:

```csharp
Services.Get<AudioService>().PlaySFX(sfxClip, transform.position, volume: 0.8f, pitch: 1.2f);
```

---

### Play Music

```csharp
Services.Get<AudioService>().PlayMusic(musicClip);
```

With custom volume, pitch, and loop settings:

```csharp
Services.Get<AudioService>().PlayMusic(musicClip, volume: 0.5f, pitch: 1f, loop: true);
```

---

### Set SFX or Music Volume (0 to 1)

```csharp
Services.Get<AudioService>().SetSFXVolume(0.7f);
Services.Get<AudioService>().SetMusicVolume(0.3f);
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The service uses a `ScriptableObject` for settings:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "AudioServiceConfig", menuName = "Configs/Services/AudioServiceConfig")]
public class AudioServiceConfig : ScriptableObject
{
    public int AudioSourcesPoolSize = 10;
    public AudioMixerGroup MusicAudioMixerGroup;
    public AudioMixerGroup SFXAudioMixerGroup;
}
```

Set these values via the **UBP Settings Window**:

```
Window > YGames > Ultimate Base Project > Audio Service
```
